This project investigates the structural drivers of digital payment adoption across 17 emerging economies (20 DPS, 2020â€“2023). Using panel data econometrics (interactive fixed effects, PCA-based indices for regulation & interoperability) and machine learning (Random Forests + SHAP values), we identify the role of regulation, interoperability, and payment service providers in shaping adoption. The analysis combines data collection from official reports and public databases, imputation via factor models, and robust empirical testing to highlight how institutional quality and infrastructure affect financial inclusion.
