# Determinants of the Adoption of Digital Payment Systems in Emerging Economies

This project investigates the key drivers behind the adoption of digital payment systems in emerging economies. Using a combination of panel data econometrics and machine learning, we identify the structural, institutional, and technological factors influencing the speed and extent of adoption.

# Summary

The analysis combines multiple approaches:
	•	Panel Data Econometrics: Interactive fixed effects models and factor models to address missing values.
	•	Machine Learning: PCA to extract latent trends and SHAP analysis for variable importance.
	•	Data Sources: Public databases (World Bank, IMF, ITU) and official reports.
	•	Scope: Cross-country analysis over multiple years, comparing adoption dynamics and heterogeneity across emerging markets.

# Conclusion

The results highlight that digital infrastructure (internet penetration, mobile subscriptions) and institutional quality are primary drivers of adoption. While some countries exhibit rapid convergence, others lag due to weaker financial inclusion and regulatory challenges. These findings provide insights for policymakers seeking to accelerate digital transformation in financial services.
